# Pathfinding GUI Application
 GUI application for pathfinding ,allowing users to set start and end points on a map and visualize paths. Utilized the Pygame library for graphical rendering, event handling, and user interactions. Implemented a custom pathfinding algorithm based on a breadth-first search (BFS)-like approach, providing efficient route calculation for user-defined points.
