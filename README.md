# Pathfinding GUI Application
 GUI application for pathfinding ,allowing users to set start and end points on a map and visualize paths. Utilized the Pygame library for graphical rendering, event handling, and user interactions. Implemented a custom pathfinding algorithm based on a breadth-first search (BFS),A* and DFS approachs , providing efficient route calculation for user-defined points.

step1: press m choose the map
step2: click on any point on the map blue indicates the source and orange indicate the destination
step3: click on spacebar
